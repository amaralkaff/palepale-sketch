### **1\. Social Sketch: The Daily Challenge App**

* **Concept:** A simple, fun drawing app focused on community engagement through daily or weekly drawing prompts. The goal isn't to be the most professional tool, but the most engaging.
* **Target Audience:** Casual artists, doodlers, and people looking for a creative social outlet.
* **Key Features:**
    * **Daily Prompts:** Every day, the app presents a new theme (e.g., "A robot gardening," "Your favorite food," "A mythical creature").
    * **Simple Toolset:** A clean, uncluttered interface with basic tools: a few brush types (pen, marker, spray paint), a color palette, an eraser, and an undo/redo button.
    * **Community Gallery:** A feed where users can see, "like," and comment on submissions for the daily prompt.
    * **Time-lapse Recording:** Automatically record the drawing process and allow users to export it as a short video for social media.
    * **User Profiles:** Simple profiles showcasing a user's gallery of past drawings.
